# Insurance Risk Predictor
 Insurance Risk Predictor - WGU Capstone Project

At a high level, the system will review a large dataset of existing customer data, such as customer age, years of driving experience, credit score, etc. That data will be evaluated and compared to identify trends and patterns consistent with risk and potential of future insurance claims. Having evaluated a large dataset for such trends, the machine learning algorithm will then be used to predict all new prospective customers to determine each customer’s unique level of risk. The risk level will be used as a variable to determine the customer’s premium pricing.
